# First Scripting Setup:

## Step 1

You can find this guide by [clicking here](https://github.com/Laumania/FireworksMania.ModTools#getting-started).

**IMPORTANT, MAKE SURE YOU CLOSED UNITY BEFORE GOING TO NEWXT STEP!!!**<br/>
After you have successfully completed each step to configure unity for modding, you can move on to **step 2**.

## Step 2
You now need to install and configure the software that will allow you to create scripts and will also allow unity to compile them so that they can be recognized by the game.

**First**, go to **Unity Hub** and click on **"Installs"** in the list on the left.
